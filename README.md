# Bloggy

A blogging website that I made!
Not made for smaller screens!!! 
Something I have learnt for next time!

https://bloggy-w7q8.onrender.com/

Loads learnt and loads I would like to have done differently!

Create it from a mobile device view first then onto a wide screen
Use Flexbox more.

I tried to play around with the text editor TinyMCE but I couldn't get it to read the data correctly. Kept getting back the data with the HTML tags as strings

Learnt lots, would defo come back to this and have another go. Like adding images or videos!
